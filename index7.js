// 7. In JavaScript, the toString method is used to convert an object to a string representation.
// By default, when an object is converted to a String, it returns a string that looks something
// like [object Object].
// However, we can define our own toString methods for custom objects to provide a more
// meaningful string representation.

function Person(name, age, gender) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.gender = gender;
}
const person1 = new Person("James Brown", 73, "male");
console.log("person1: " + person1); //prints person1: [object Object]

// a) Define a custom toString method for the Person object that will format and print
// their details

// b) Test your method by creating 2 different people using the below constructor function
// and printing them

// c) Create a new constructor function Student that uses call to inherit from Person and
// add an extra property cohort

// d) Add a custom toString for Student objects that formats and prints their details. Test
// with 2 students.
